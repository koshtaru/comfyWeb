		{
			"taskId": 13,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Queue Management with Cancel Button",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the cancel button implementation into components: 1) Create the button component with design system styling and states, 2) Integrate with ComfyUI /interrupt API endpoint, 3) Implement button state management tied to generation status, 4) Add confirmation dialog with accessibility, 5) Position and integrate button with existing UI layout",
			"reasoning": "This task involves multiple layers of complexity: UI component creation, API integration, state management synchronization, user interaction flows, and careful UI integration. The existing 5 subtasks are well-structured and appropriate for the complexity level."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 14,
			"taskTitle": "Build Metadata Extraction and Display System",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Create subtasks for: 1) Build parser module for ComfyUI history responses, 2) Implement timing calculation utilities, 3) Design collapsible metadata panel component structure, 4) Apply dark theme styling and responsive layout, 5) Add clipboard functionality and WebSocket integration",
			"reasoning": "This task requires parsing complex JSON structures, calculating timing data, creating an organized UI component with multiple sections, and integrating with existing systems. The metadata variety and display requirements justify 5 subtasks."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 15,
			"taskTitle": "Create Advanced Sampler Selection Component",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Organize into: 1) Define sampler data structures and metadata, 2) Build styled dropdown component with search, 3) Implement KSampler node detection logic, 4) Create workflow update functionality, 5) Integrate with Advanced Parameters section",
			"reasoning": "While conceptually straightforward as a dropdown component, the task involves workflow JSON parsing, node detection, validation logic, and integration with existing systems. The 13 sampler options and tooltip requirements add complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 16,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Scheduler Selection Component",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Structure as: 1) Create dropdown component with scheduler options, 2) Implement sampler-scheduler compatibility validation matrix, 3) Connect to workflow JSON for read/write operations, 4) Add informative tooltips for each scheduler type, 5) Complete integration testing and UI polish",
			"reasoning": "The compatibility validation between samplers and schedulers adds significant complexity beyond a simple dropdown. The task requires understanding ComfyUI's compatibility rules and implementing proper validation logic."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 17,
			"taskTitle": "Build Comprehensive Seed Control System",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide into: 1) Create validated seed input component, 2) Implement cryptographically secure random generator, 3) Build increment/decrement controls with edge case handling, 4) Add localStorage persistence with custom hook, 5) Connect to workflow JSON bidirectionally",
			"reasoning": "The seed control involves multiple features: validation, random generation, increment/decrement logic, persistence, and workflow integration. Each aspect has specific requirements and edge cases to handle."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 18,
			"taskTitle": "Integrate Advanced Parameters with Workflow Engine",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into: 1) Create WorkflowModificationService extending existing functionality, 2) Enhance node detection for advanced parameters, 3) Build parameter injection system, 4) Implement comprehensive validation and compatibility checks, 5) Integrate with submission pipeline and persistence",
			"reasoning": "This is a complex integration task that touches multiple systems. It requires extending existing services, handling multiple node types, implementing validation logic, and ensuring seamless integration with the workflow pipeline."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 19,
			"taskTitle": "Create Advanced Parameters UI Section",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Structure as: 1) Build collapsible container with accordion functionality, 2) Design responsive parameter grouping layout, 3) Integrate existing parameter components, 4) Add contextual help tooltips, 5) Ensure full accessibility compliance",
			"reasoning": "This is primarily a UI organization task that brings together existing components. The complexity lies in creating a cohesive, accessible, and responsive layout rather than complex logic."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 20,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Comprehensive Error Handling and State Management",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Organize into: 1) Create global error boundary component, 2) Build toast notification system, 3) Enhance WebSocket error handling with retry logic, 4) Implement loading states for async operations, 5) Add graceful degradation and feature detection",
			"reasoning": "This is one of the most complex tasks as it requires implementing cross-cutting concerns that affect the entire application. Error handling, state management, and graceful degradation require careful architecture and thorough testing."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 21,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Workflow Preset Management System",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide into: 1) Create data model and localStorage service, 2) Build preset management modal UI, 3) Implement quick-access dropdown component, 4) Add import/export and default preset features, 5) Integrate with existing workflow system and add storage management",
			"reasoning": "This is a comprehensive feature requiring data persistence, complex UI components, import/export functionality, and deep integration with existing systems. The storage management and conflict resolution add additional complexity."
