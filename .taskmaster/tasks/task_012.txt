# Task ID: 12
# Title: Create Real-time Progress Bar Component
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 11
# Priority: high
# Description: Build an animated progress bar component that displays generation progress with live updates from WebSocket events
# Details:
Create a React component with green progress bar styling using design system colors. Subscribe to WebSocket progress events and update UI state. Display current step, total steps, and percentage completion. Implement smooth CSS transitions for progress animations. Handle edge cases: rapid updates, completion states, error states. Style with dark theme consistency and proper typography. Show/hide based on generation state.

# Test Strategy:
Component tests for progress calculation and display. Visual regression tests for progress bar animations. Integration tests with WebSocket service for live updates. Manual testing with various generation speeds and interruptions.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design Progress Bar Component Structure and Styling [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the base React component with HTML structure and CSS styling following the dark theme design system
### Details:
Create ProgressBar.js component with container div, progress bar track, and fill elements. Implement CSS with dark theme colors (#0b0f19 background, #181825 panel), green gradient for progress fill (#22c55e to #16a34a), smooth transitions (transition: width 0.3s ease-out), and proper typography (Helvetica Neue). Include states for hidden, active, completed, and error. Add responsive design considerations for mobile views.

## 2. Implement WebSocket Event Subscription and State Management [done]
### Dependencies: 12.1
### Description: Connect progress bar to WebSocket service and manage progress state updates from generation events
### Details:
Create useWebSocketProgress custom hook to subscribe to progress events. Handle 'execution_start', 'executing', 'progress', and 'execution_complete' event types. Parse WebSocket messages to extract current_node, max_nodes, and value fields. Implement state management for currentStep, totalSteps, percentage, isGenerating, and lastUpdate timestamp. Handle rapid update throttling to prevent UI jank. Clean up subscriptions on unmount.

## 3. Build Progress Display UI with Step Counter and Percentage [done]
### Dependencies: 12.1, 12.2
### Description: Create the visual progress indicators showing current step, total steps, and percentage completion
### Details:
Add progress text overlay showing 'Step X of Y (Z%)' format. Position text centered on progress bar with proper contrast (#ffffff text with subtle shadow). Implement number formatting for clean display (no decimals for percentage). Add loading shimmer effect during initial connection. Handle edge cases: 0 total steps, percentage > 100%, negative values. Include accessibility features with ARIA labels and live region announcements.

## 4. Handle Progress Bar Visibility and Generation States [done]
### Dependencies: 12.2, 12.3
### Description: Implement show/hide logic based on generation state and handle various completion scenarios
### Details:
Show progress bar only during active generation (fade in with opacity transition). Hide on completion with 1-second delay for user feedback. Handle error states with red color scheme (#ef4444) and error message display. Implement generation cancellation handling to reset progress. Add completion animation (pulse effect) before hiding. Store last generation stats for display after completion. Handle disconnection scenarios gracefully.

## 5. Optimize Performance and Handle Edge Cases [done]
### Dependencies: 12.1, 12.2, 12.3, 12.4
### Description: Implement performance optimizations and robust error handling for production reliability
### Details:
Implement requestAnimationFrame for smooth progress updates. Add debouncing for rapid WebSocket messages (16ms threshold). Handle browser tab visibility changes to pause/resume updates. Implement retry logic for WebSocket connection failures. Add progress bar memory to resume from last position on reconnect. Handle extremely long generations (>1000 steps) with appropriate scaling. Prevent progress bar overflow or negative values. Add performance monitoring for update frequency.
