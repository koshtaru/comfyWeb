# Title: Generation Settings UI Alignment Fixes and Integration
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1, 14
# Priority: medium
# Description: Fix visual alignment issues in Generation Settings component including card heights, button positioning, text overflow, and grid layout problems, then integrate the component into GeneratePage to replace ParameterDisplay.
# Details:
1. **CSS Alignment Fixes**: Fix inconsistent card heights in generation settings by implementing uniform min-height values and proper flex/grid alignment. Resolve button alignment issues by standardizing button container heights and using consistent margin/padding values. Address text overflow problems with proper ellipsis handling and word-wrap for long parameter names. Fix grid layout spacing issues by adjusting gap values and ensuring proper column sizing.

2. **Component Integration**: Replace the existing ParameterDisplay component in GeneratePage with the new GenerationSettings component. Update import statements and component references. Ensure proper prop passing for workflow data, metadata, and event handlers. Maintain existing functionality while improving visual presentation.

3. **TypeScript Error Resolution**: Fix any TypeScript compilation errors that arise from the component integration. Update type definitions for props and state if needed. Ensure proper typing for event handlers and data structures.

4. **CSS File Organization**: Apply fixes from GenerationSettingsFixes.css and GenerationSettingsPolish.css to the main component styles. Consolidate CSS rules to avoid conflicts and ensure consistent styling across the application.

5. **Testing Integration**: Verify that all existing functionality continues to work after component replacement. Test responsiveness, dark theme consistency, and parameter display accuracy.

# Test Strategy:
1. **Visual Regression Testing**: Compare before/after screenshots of GeneratePage to verify alignment improvements. Test at multiple screen sizes to ensure responsive behavior is maintained. Validate that card heights are uniform and button alignment is consistent.

2. **Functional Testing**: Load various workflow files and verify that all parameters display correctly in the new component. Test parameter editing and ensure changes propagate properly. Verify that workflow upload and metadata extraction continue to work seamlessly.

3. **TypeScript Compilation**: Run TypeScript compiler to verify no type errors exist. Test in development and production builds to ensure proper compilation.

4. **Cross-browser Testing**: Test the integrated component in Chrome, Firefox, and Safari to ensure consistent rendering and functionality. Pay special attention to CSS grid and flexbox behavior across browsers.

5. **Integration Testing**: Test the complete workflow from file upload through parameter display to ensure the component integration doesn't break existing functionality.
