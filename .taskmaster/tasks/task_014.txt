COMPLETED: Fixed MetadataPanel CSS Grid layout positioning issue.

PROBLEM: The 3-column layout (Generation Settings, Image Properties, Timing Information) wasn't working correctly. The Timing Information section was appearing below Image Properties instead of in the third column of the same row.

ROOT CAUSE: The nth-child CSS selectors were incorrect. The HTML structure includes a title element as the first child, so the metadata sections are actually children 2, 3, and 4, not 1, 2, and 3.

SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:
1. Identified HTML structure in generatePanelHTML() method:
   - Child 1: .metadata-title (Generation Details)
   - Child 2: Generation Settings .metadata-section 
   - Child 3: Image Properties .metadata-section
   - Child 4: Timing Information .metadata-section
   - Child 5: .metadata-prompt-section (full width)
   - Child 6: .metadata-actions (full width)

2. Updated CSS Grid positioning in style.css:
   - .metadata-section:nth-child(2) { grid-column: 1; grid-row: 1; }
   - .metadata-section:nth-child(3) { grid-column: 2; grid-row: 1; } 
   - .metadata-section:nth-child(4) { grid-column: 3; grid-row: 1; }

RESULT: All three sections now appear correctly in the first row with proper grid positioning, and the Prompt Information section spans full width below them.

FILES MODIFIED:
- /Users/james.crawford/ComfyotgTest/style.css (lines 1744-1747)

TECHNICAL DETAILS:
- Used explicit CSS Grid positioning with nth-child selectors
- Maintained responsive breakpoints for mobile/tablet views
- Preserved existing full-width sections (.metadata-prompt-section, .metadata-actions)
- Layout now matches user requirements: 3 columns top row + full-width bottom row

Create organized layout with proper spacing: 16px padding, 8px between items. Style parameter labels with #8B8B9A and values with #FFFFFF. Add hover states for interactive elements. Implement responsive layout for mobile screens. Use CSS Grid or Flexbox for parameter organization. Add subtle shadows and rounded corners matching design system.

## 5. Add Copy-to-Clipboard and Integration Features [done]
### Dependencies: 14.3, 14.4
### Description: Implement clipboard functionality and integrate metadata panel with existing UI
### Details:
Add copy buttons for individual parameters and full metadata export. Implement clipboard API with fallback for older browsers. Create formatted text output for sharing (JSON or readable text format). Show success feedback on copy actions. Integrate metadata panel into main UI layout, positioning below image display.
