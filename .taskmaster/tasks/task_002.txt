# Task ID: 2
# Title: Implement API Connection Management with Design System UI
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Build functionality to configure and test ComfyUI API endpoint connection using Stable Diffusion WebUI design patterns
# Details:
Create functions to handle API URL configuration with default value 'http://localhost:8188', implement connection testing via fetch API, add visual status indicators (connected/disconnected) using blue accent colors (#1f77b4) for connected state and red for disconnected. Store endpoint in localStorage for persistence. Style the API configuration panel with dark theme (#181825 panel background), use Helvetica Neue typography, and implement hover/focus states consistent with design system. Include error handling for network failures and invalid URLs with styled error messages.

# Test Strategy:
Test connection with valid ComfyUI instance, verify localStorage persistence, test with invalid URLs and offline scenarios, validate design consistency with WebUI components
