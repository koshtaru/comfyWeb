This caused the main generation error handler to see the WebSocket error as a real error rather than expected cancellation behavior.\n\nSOLUTION: Modified the cancellation flow to keep the isCancellationInProgress flag active until the WebSocket execution_error event is received and processed. Added safety timeout to clear flag after 3 seconds if WebSocket event doesn't come.\n\nTECHNICAL CHANGES:\n1. Modified cancel button handler to keep cancellation flag active after successful interrupt\n2. Added safety timeout (3 seconds) to clear flag in case WebSocket event doesn't arrive\n3.

        "details": "Implement a comprehensive CSS migration strategy with the following components:\n\n1. **Design System Migration**: Extract CSS variables from style.css (:root definitions) into a centralized theme configuration. Create theme provider using React Context API to enable dynamic theming. Preserve exact color values: --color-bg-primary (#0b0f19), --color-bg-secondary (#181825), --color-bg-tertiary (#1f2937), --color-accent-orange (#ff7c00), --color-accent-blue (#1f77b4). Migrate typography scales, spacing units, and shadow definitions to JavaScript theme object.\n\n2. **CSS Architecture Selection**: Evaluate and implement CSS-in-JS solution (styled-components or emotion) vs CSS Modules based on bundle size and performance requirements. For CSS-in-JS: Install styled-components with TypeScript definitions, create styled.d.ts for theme typing, implement global styles with createGlobalStyle. For CSS Modules: Configure Vite for CSS Modules support, create component.module.css files, implement typed CSS modules with typescript-plugin-css-modules.\n\n3. **Component Architecture Setup**: Create atomic design structure: atoms (Button, Input, Label), molecules (FormField, Card, Modal), organisms (Header, Sidebar, GenerationControls). Implement base components with proper TypeScript interfaces and prop validation. Create compound components for complex UI patterns (Tab.Group, Tab.List, Tab.Panel). Establish naming conventions and file organization patterns.\n\n4. **Responsive Design System**: Migrate existing breakpoints (480px, 768px, 1024px) to JavaScript constants or CSS custom properties. Implement responsive utilities using CSS Grid and Flexbox with mobile-first approach. Create useMediaQuery custom hook for JavaScript-based responsive behavior. Build responsive typography scale with clamp() for fluid sizing. Ensure touch-friendly tap targets (minimum 44px) on mobile devices.\n\n5. **Style Migration Strategy**: Create migration checklist for each CSS file section. Start with global styles and CSS reset, then migrate component styles in dependency order. Preserve all hover states, focus styles, and transition animations. Maintain exact visual parity with before/after screenshot comparisons. Document any CSS specificity changes or cascade differences.\n\n6. **Performance Optimization**: Implement CSS code splitting by route or component lazy loading.

Verify CSS variables are correctly injected and accessible. Test theme switching functionality if implemented. Validate TypeScript theme typing catches invalid theme values.\n\n3. **Component Testing**: Write unit tests for each migrated component using React Testing Library. Test component props, states, and event handlers. Verify CSS classes or styled-components are applied correctly. Test responsive behavior with different viewport sizes.\n\n4. **Performance Testing**: Measure initial CSS bundle size vs new implementation. Run Lighthouse performance audits before and after migration. Test time to first contentful paint (FCP) and largest contentful paint (LCP). Verify no CSS-in-JS runtime performance degradation.\n\n5. **Cross-Browser Testing**: Test on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge latest versions. Verify CSS Grid and Flexbox layouts render consistently. Test CSS custom properties fallbacks for older browsers. Validate responsive design on actual mobile devices (iOS Safari, Chrome Android).\n\n6. **Accessibility Testing**: Run axe-core automated accessibility tests on all components.

Define interface `IPromptInputProps` with properties: value (string), onChange (function), placeholder (string), maxLength (number), minHeight (number), maxHeight (number), validationRules (array), onValidationChange (function). Implement controlled component pattern with proper state management. Create custom hooks: `useAutoResize` for dynamic height adjustment, `useValidation` for real-time prompt validation, `useCharacterCount` for length tracking.\n\n2. **Enhanced Textarea Features**: Implement auto-resize functionality that grows/shrinks based on content while respecting min/max height constraints. Add character counter displaying current/max characters with visual warning states at 80% and 95% thresholds. Implement syntax highlighting for common prompt weights and modifiers (e.g., (word:1.2), [word], <lora:name:weight>). Add prompt history with up/down arrow key navigation stored in localStorage. Implement paste formatting that cleans up multi-line prompts and removes excessive whitespace.\n\n3. **Validation System**: Create comprehensive validation framework supporting: minimum/maximum length validation, forbidden word detection, syntax validation for weight modifiers, balanced parentheses/brackets checking. Display inline validation messages below textarea with smooth fade-in animations. Implement debounced validation to avoid UI flicker during typing. Support custom validation rules passed via props for extensibility.\n\n4. **Styling and Theme Integration**: Migrate existing textarea styles preserving exact dark theme colors and spacing. Remove fieldset borders while maintaining visual hierarchy through proper spacing and subtle backgrounds. Implement focus states with accent color outline (#ff7c00) and smooth transitions. Add hover states with slight background lightening for better interactivity. Ensure consistent padding (16px) and comfortable line-height (1.6) for extended typing sessions.\n\n5. **Accessibility Implementation**: Add proper ARIA labels and descriptions for screen readers. Implement keyboard shortcuts: Ctrl/Cmd+Enter for submission, Escape to clear focus, Tab for proper focus management. Provide clear focus indicators meeting WCAG contrast requirements. Add aria-live regions for validation message announcements. Support high contrast mode with appropriate CSS media queries.\n\n6. **Performance Optimizations**: Implement React.memo with proper comparison function to prevent unnecessary re-renders. Use useCallback for event handlers to maintain referential stability. Debounce validation and auto-resize calculations for smooth performance. Implement virtual scrolling for prompt history dropdown if history exceeds 50 items. Use CSS containment for better paint performance during resize operations.\n\n7. **Integration with Existing Systems**: Emit custom events for backward compatibility with vanilla JS components during migration. Maintain localStorage key structure for prompt history compatibility. Support both controlled and uncontrolled component patterns. Provide imperative handle using useImperativeHandle for focus management. Ensure seamless integration with form submission and generation workflow.",
