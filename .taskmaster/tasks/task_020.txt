# Task ID: 20
# Title: Implement Comprehensive Error Handling and State Management
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 11, 12, 13, 14, 18
# Priority: high
# Description: Add robust error handling, loading states, and user feedback for all new Phase 2 features
# Details:
Implement error boundaries for new feature components to prevent app crashes. Add comprehensive error handling for WebSocket failures, API errors, and invalid parameter states. Create loading states for all async operations. Implement user feedback system with toast notifications for errors and success states. Add graceful degradation when ComfyUI features are unavailable. Include retry mechanisms for transient failures and proper error recovery flows.

# Test Strategy:
Error scenario testing for network failures, invalid parameters, and ComfyUI unavailability. Stress testing with rapid user interactions and state changes. Integration testing for error recovery flows. User testing for error message clarity and recovery guidance.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create Global Error Boundary Component [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Build a React error boundary component to catch and handle errors across the entire application
### Details:
Implement a comprehensive error boundary component that wraps the main App component. Include error logging, fallback UI with retry capability, and error reporting. Add specific error handling for common scenarios like network failures, invalid JSON parsing, and component crashes. Integrate with existing design system for consistent error UI styling.

## 2. Implement Toast Notification System [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a centralized toast notification service for displaying error and success messages
### Details:
Build a toast notification system using React context and hooks. Support multiple toast types (error, success, warning, info) with appropriate styling from design system. Implement auto-dismiss with configurable durations, manual dismiss capability, and stacking for multiple simultaneous notifications. Include accessibility features like screen reader announcements and keyboard navigation.

## 3. Add WebSocket Error Handling and Retry Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 20.2
### Description: Enhance WebSocket connection manager with comprehensive error handling and automatic retry mechanisms
### Details:
Extend the WebSocket service to handle connection failures, unexpected disconnections, and invalid message formats. Implement exponential backoff for reconnection attempts with configurable max retries. Add connection state indicators and user-friendly error messages via toast notifications. Include manual reconnection option and connection health monitoring.

## 4. Create Loading States for Async Operations [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement loading indicators and skeleton screens for all asynchronous operations in Phase 2 features
### Details:
Design and implement loading states for queue operations, parameter updates, scheduler changes, and seed randomization. Create reusable loading components including spinners, skeleton screens, and progress indicators. Ensure loading states prevent duplicate actions and provide clear visual feedback. Integrate with existing UI components maintaining design consistency.

## 5. Implement Graceful Degradation and Feature Detection [pending]
### Dependencies: 20.1, 20.2, 20.3
### Description: Add capability detection and fallback behaviors when ComfyUI features are unavailable
### Details:
Create a feature detection service that checks ComfyUI endpoint availability and capabilities on startup. Implement graceful degradation for missing features: disable unavailable controls, show informative messages, and provide alternative workflows. Add version compatibility checks and feature flags. Include clear user guidance when features are limited or unavailable.
