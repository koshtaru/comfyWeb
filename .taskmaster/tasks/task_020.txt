# Task ID: 20
# Title: Implement Comprehensive Error Handling and State Management
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 11, 12, 13, 14, 18
# Priority: high
# Description: Add robust error handling, loading states, and user feedback for all new Phase 2 features
# Details:
Implement error boundaries for new feature components to prevent app crashes. Add comprehensive error handling for WebSocket failures, API errors, and invalid parameter states. Create loading states for all async operations. Implement user feedback system with toast notifications for errors and success states. Add graceful degradation when ComfyUI features are unavailable. Include retry mechanisms for transient failures and proper error recovery flows.

# Test Strategy:
Error scenario testing for network failures, invalid parameters, and ComfyUI unavailability. Stress testing with rapid user interactions and state changes. Integration testing for error recovery flows. User testing for error message clarity and recovery guidance.
