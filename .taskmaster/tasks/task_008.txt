# Description: Implement download functionality and results clearing options using design system button styles
# Details:
Add styled download buttons for each generated image using orange gradient primary button styling, implement blob URLs and anchor download attributes. Create styled clearResults() function button with secondary styling, manage memory cleanup for blob URLs. Add batch download option with consistent button styling if multiple images exist. All buttons should follow design system patterns with proper hover states, Helvetica Neue typography, and consistent spacing.

# Test Strategy:
Test individual image downloads, verify results clearing functionality, test memory management with multiple generations, validate button styling consistency
