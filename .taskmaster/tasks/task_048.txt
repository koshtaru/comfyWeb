# Task ID: 48
# Title: Document Bug Fixes and Debugging Session Summary for ComfyUI React Prompt Override System
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 6, 26, 44, 45, 46, 47
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create comprehensive documentation tracking all bug fixes completed in this session, including parameter extraction fixes, workflow format handling, preset loading behavior improvements, and UI state management corrections for the ComfyUI React prompt override system.
# Details:
Create a detailed debugging session summary document based on the actual fixes completed in this session:

1. **Session Overview**: Document the comprehensive debugging session focused on the ComfyUI React prompt override system. The session resolved 5 critical issues affecting parameter extraction, preset loading, and prompt override functionality.

2. **Parameter Extraction Fixes**: Document the two major parameter extractor issues resolved:
   - Invalid node structure warnings caused by overly strict safety checks
   - TypeError from calling toLowerCase() on undefined node type values
   Include before/after code examples from src/utils/parameterExtractor.ts

3. **Prompt Override Navigation Bug**: Document the critical issue where presets would load but prompt override field remained greyed out after navigation from PresetsPage to GeneratePage. Detail the root cause (parameter extraction working but data not updating prompt override state) and solution (updated loadPresetDirect function).

4. **Workflow Format Compatibility Fix**: Document the workflow format mismatch where applyPromptOverride couldn't find nodes because workflows were in ComfyUI UI export format instead of direct node mapping format. Include examples of both formats and the enhanced detection logic implemented in src/utils/promptOverride.ts.

5. **Preset Loading Behavior Correction**: Document the fix for automatic override behavior where loading any preset would force-enable the override toggle and replace custom text. Detail how this was changed to preserve user choices and manual control.

6. **Root Cause Analysis**: For each fix, analyze why the bugs occurred, focusing on format assumptions, state management patterns, and data flow issues between components.

7. **Testing Verification**: Document that all major functionality is now working correctly including parameter extraction, prompt override application, preset loading, and state preservation.

8. **Files Modified Summary**: List all files modified during the session:
   - src/utils/parameterExtractor.ts
   - src/pages/GeneratePage.tsx
   - src/utils/promptOverride.ts

# Test Strategy:
1. **Bug Fix Verification**: Verify each of the 5 documented bug fixes accurately reflects the actual code changes and testing performed during the session.

2. **Code Example Accuracy**: Validate that documented before/after examples match the actual modifications made to parameterExtractor.ts, GeneratePage.tsx, and promptOverride.ts.

3. **Workflow Format Documentation**: Test that workflow format examples accurately represent both ComfyUI UI export format and direct node mapping format, and verify the detection logic works as documented.

4. **State Management Testing**: Confirm documented preset loading behavior changes preserve user override settings and don't force unwanted state changes.

5. **Session Completeness**: Ensure all critical fixes from the debugging session are captured, including parameter extraction, navigation bugs, format compatibility, and user experience improvements.
