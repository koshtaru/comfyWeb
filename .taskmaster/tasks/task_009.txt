# Task ID: 9
# Title: Implement User Interface State Management with Design System Feedback
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 6, 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Add loading indicators, progress states, and user feedback throughout the workflow using consistent styling
# Details:
Add styled loading spinners during API calls using blue accent colors, disable generate button during processing with proper disabled state styling. Show generation progress if available from API using styled progress bars with design system colors. Implement comprehensive user feedback for all operations (upload success, parameter changes, generation start/complete) using consistent toast/notification styling with dark backgrounds and proper typography. Add visual states for different application phases maintaining design consistency.

# Test Strategy:
Test all loading states and user feedback, verify UI remains responsive during operations, test progress indicators with actual generations, validate all feedback styling matches design system
