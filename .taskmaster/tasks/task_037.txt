# Task ID: 37
# Title: Phase 4.2: Production Deployment and CI/CD Pipeline - Set up automated deployment pipeline with build optimization, testing automation, and production monitoring
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 35
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline with automated testing, build optimization, multi-environment deployment strategies, and production monitoring for the React-migrated ComfyUI interface, ensuring zero-downtime deployments and robust error tracking
# Details:
Implement a production-ready CI/CD pipeline with the following components:

1. **CI/CD Pipeline Architecture**:
   - Set up GitHub Actions workflow with matrix builds for multiple Node.js versions (18.x, 20.x)
   - Configure multi-stage pipeline: lint → test → build → deploy with dependency caching
   - Implement semantic versioning with automated changelog generation using conventional commits
   - Set up branch protection rules requiring passing tests and code review approvals
   - Configure automated dependency updates with Dependabot and security scanning

2. **Build Optimization**:
   - Configure Webpack 5 production build with code splitting and tree shaking
   - Implement dynamic imports for route-based code splitting in React components
   - Set up asset optimization: image compression, font subsetting, CSS/JS minification
   - Configure build-time environment variable injection for API endpoints
   - Implement bundle analysis with webpack-bundle-analyzer for size monitoring
   - Set up source map generation with proper security headers in production

3. **Testing Automation**:
   - Integrate Jest test suite execution with coverage reporting to Codecov
   - Set up Cypress E2E tests for critical user flows (workflow upload, generation, preset management)
   - Configure Lighthouse CI for performance regression testing
   - Implement visual regression testing with Percy or Chromatic
   - Set up parallel test execution to reduce CI runtime
   - Configure test result reporting with GitHub annotations

4. **Deployment Strategy**:
   - Implement blue-green deployment strategy with automated rollback capabilities
   - Configure Docker containerization with multi-stage builds for optimal image size
   - Set up Kubernetes deployment manifests with health checks and resource limits
   - Implement feature flags using LaunchDarkly or similar for gradual rollouts
   - Configure CDN deployment for static assets with cache invalidation
   - Set up SSL/TLS certificates with automated renewal via Let's Encrypt

5. **Production Monitoring**:
   - Integrate Sentry for real-time error tracking with source map support
   - Configure DataDog or New Relic for application performance monitoring (APM)
   - Set up custom metrics for ComfyUI-specific operations (generation time, WebSocket stability)
   - Implement structured logging with correlation IDs for request tracing
   - Configure uptime monitoring with PagerDuty integration for incident management
   - Set up real user monitoring (RUM) for client-side performance metrics

6. **Infrastructure as Code**:
   - Define infrastructure using Terraform for cloud resource provisioning
   - Implement GitOps workflow with ArgoCD for Kubernetes deployments
   - Configure automated backup strategies for user data and presets
   - Set up disaster recovery procedures with RTO/RPO targets
   - Implement cost monitoring and optimization alerts

7. **Security Hardening**:
   - Configure OWASP dependency scanning in CI pipeline
   - Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) headers for XSS protection
   - Set up rate limiting and DDoS protection at CDN level
   - Configure secrets management with HashiCorp Vault or AWS Secrets Manager
   - Implement automated security patches with scheduled vulnerability scans

# Test Strategy:
1. **Pipeline Verification**:
   - Verify GitHub Actions workflow triggers correctly on push/PR events
   - Test matrix builds complete successfully across all Node.js versions
   - Confirm dependency caching reduces build times by at least 50%
   - Validate semantic versioning generates correct version numbers
   - Test rollback mechanism successfully reverts to previous deployment

2. **Build Optimization Testing**:
   - Verify production bundle size is under 500KB for initial load
   - Confirm code splitting creates separate chunks for each major route
   - Test lazy-loaded components load on-demand without errors
   - Validate all environment variables are correctly injected at build time
   - Ensure source maps are generated but not publicly accessible

3. **Automated Testing Validation**:
   - Confirm all Jest unit tests pass with >80% coverage threshold
   - Verify Cypress E2E tests complete critical user journeys successfully
   - Test Lighthouse CI catches performance regressions (LCP < 2.5s, FID < 100ms)
   - Validate visual regression tests detect unintended UI changes
   - Ensure parallel test execution reduces total CI time to under 10 minutes

4. **Deployment Testing**:
   - Test blue-green deployment switches traffic without downtime
   - Verify Docker images build successfully and are under 100MB
   - Confirm Kubernetes pods pass health checks and restart on failure
   - Test feature flags correctly enable/disable functionality
   - Validate CDN serves assets with proper cache headers

5. **Monitoring Validation**:
   - Verify Sentry captures and groups errors with correct stack traces
   - Test APM dashboards show real-time metrics for all endpoints
   - Confirm custom metrics track ComfyUI operations accurately
   - Validate alert thresholds trigger notifications appropriately
   - Test correlation IDs enable end-to-end request tracing

6. **Load and Stress Testing**:
   - Perform load testing with k6 to verify 1000 concurrent users
   - Test WebSocket connections remain stable under high load
   - Verify auto-scaling triggers at defined CPU/memory thresholds
   - Validate rate limiting prevents API abuse without affecting legitimate users
   - Test disaster recovery procedures meet RTO < 1 hour, RPO < 15 minutes
