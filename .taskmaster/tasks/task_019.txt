# Task ID: 19
# Title: Create Advanced Parameters UI Section
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 15, 16, 17
# Priority: medium
# Description: Build organized UI section housing all advanced controls with consistent design system styling
# Details:
Create collapsible 'Advanced Parameters' section with accordion-style expansion. Organize sampler, scheduler, and seed controls in logical groupings. Implement responsive layout for different screen sizes. Style with dark theme consistency and proper spacing. Add section state persistence in localStorage. Include help tooltips and parameter explanations. Ensure accessibility with proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation.

# Test Strategy:
Visual regression tests for section styling and responsive behavior. Accessibility testing with screen readers and keyboard navigation. User testing for parameter organization and discoverability. Cross-browser compatibility testing.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create Advanced Parameters Container Component [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Build the main collapsible container component for housing all advanced parameter controls with dark theme styling
### Details:
Create a React component that serves as the collapsible container for advanced parameters. Implement accordion-style expansion/collapse functionality with smooth CSS transitions. Style with dark theme colors (#181825 background, #0b0f19 borders) and proper spacing (16px padding). Add chevron icon that rotates on expand/collapse. Implement state persistence in localStorage to remember expanded/collapsed state between sessions. Include proper ARIA attributes (aria-expanded, aria-controls) for accessibility.

## 2. Design Parameter Grouping Layout System [pending]
### Dependencies: 19.1
### Description: Create a flexible layout system for organizing parameter controls into logical groups with responsive behavior
### Details:
Implement a grid-based layout system within the advanced parameters container. Create visual groupings for sampler controls, scheduler options, and seed/randomization settings using subtle borders (#1f2937) and spacing. Design responsive breakpoints (mobile: single column, tablet: 2 columns, desktop: 3 columns). Add group headers with consistent typography (14px, #94a3b8 color). Ensure proper spacing between groups (24px) and within groups (12px). Implement CSS Grid or Flexbox for flexible, maintainable layouts.

## 3. Integrate Parameter Components into Section [pending]
### Dependencies: 19.2
### Description: Mount existing sampler, scheduler, and seed components within the advanced parameters section with proper styling integration
### Details:
Import and integrate the sampler selection dropdown (Task 15), scheduler component (Task 16), and seed control (Task 17) into their designated groups. Ensure consistent styling by applying section-specific CSS classes. Wire up component props and state management. Verify that all components inherit the dark theme styling properly. Add wrapper divs with appropriate spacing and alignment. Ensure form controls maintain their functionality within the new layout structure.

## 4. Implement Help Tooltips and Parameter Documentation [pending]
### Dependencies: 19.3
### Description: Add contextual help tooltips and explanations for each parameter group to improve user understanding
### Details:
Create a reusable tooltip component with dark theme styling (#1f2937 background, white text). Add info icons (?) next to each parameter group header. Write concise, helpful explanations for samplers (algorithm differences, use cases), schedulers (noise schedule effects), and seed controls (reproducibility concepts). Implement hover/focus triggers with proper delay (300ms show, 100ms hide). Position tooltips intelligently to avoid viewport edges. Include keyboard accessibility (focus shows tooltip).

## 5. Add Accessibility and Keyboard Navigation [pending]
### Dependencies: 19.4
### Description: Ensure complete accessibility compliance with ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, and screen reader support
### Details:
Implement full keyboard navigation for the advanced parameters section. Add Tab navigation through all controls in logical order. Implement Enter/Space to expand/collapse the section. Add descriptive ARIA labels for all controls and groups. Ensure proper heading hierarchy (h3 for section title, h4 for group headers). Test with screen readers (NVDA, JAWS) and fix any announcement issues. Add focus indicators that meet WCAG contrast requirements. Include skip links for keyboard users to bypass the section if collapsed.
