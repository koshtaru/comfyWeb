# Task ID: 23
# Title: Implement Workflow Preset Management System with Local Storage Persistence
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 3, 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a comprehensive preset management system allowing users to save, load, and manage ComfyUI workflow JSON files locally with automatic loading of last used workflow
# Details:
Build a workflow preset management system with the following components:

1. **Preset Storage Architecture**: Design localStorage schema for workflow presets using key pattern 'comfyui_preset_{id}' for individual presets and 'comfyui_preset_metadata' for preset list management. Include preset metadata: id, name, createdAt, lastUsedAt, workflowData. Implement storage size management with compression if needed.

2. **Preset Management UI**: Create collapsible preset panel matching design system (#181825 background, blue accents). Implement dropdown/list component showing saved presets with custom names, creation dates, and last used indicators. Add 'Save Current Workflow' button with modal for custom naming. Include delete buttons with confirmation dialogs. Style all components with Helvetica Neue typography and consistent spacing.

3. **Save Functionality**: Implement saveWorkflowPreset() function that captures current uploaded workflow JSON, prompts for custom name via modal dialog, generates unique ID, stores compressed workflow data in localStorage. Update preset metadata list. Handle storage quota errors gracefully.

4. **Load Functionality**: Create loadWorkflowPreset() function that retrieves selected preset from localStorage, decompresses workflow data, loads into current workflow state, updates UI to reflect loaded workflow. Update lastUsedAt timestamp in metadata.

5. **Delete Functionality**: Implement deleteWorkflowPreset() with confirmation dialog, remove from localStorage, update metadata list, handle currently loaded preset deletion edge case.

6. **Auto-load Last Used**: On page load, check localStorage for 'comfyui_last_workflow_id', automatically load last used workflow if exists, update UI to show loaded preset name. Implement fallback to default/empty state if preset missing.

7. **Preset List Management**: Create sortable preset list with options for sort by name, created date, or last used. Implement search/filter functionality for large preset collections. Add export/import all presets feature for backup.

8. **Storage Management**: Monitor localStorage usage, implement warning when approaching quota (5MB typical limit), provide option to export old presets before deletion. Implement preset compression using LZ-string or similar.

# Test Strategy:
1. **Storage Tests**: Verify preset save/load cycle preserves workflow integrity. Test localStorage quota handling with large workflows. Validate compression/decompression accuracy. Test metadata updates and consistency.

2. **UI Component Tests**: Test preset dropdown population and selection. Verify save modal validation and error handling. Test delete confirmation flow. Validate auto-load on page refresh.

3. **Integration Tests**: Test full workflow: upload JSON, save as preset, reload page, verify auto-load. Test preset switching during active generation. Verify preset management doesn't interfere with API operations.

4. **Edge Case Tests**: Test with corrupted localStorage data. Verify behavior when preset deleted while loaded. Test concurrent preset operations. Validate handling of duplicate preset names.

5. **Performance Tests**: Measure impact of large preset collections on UI responsiveness. Test localStorage operations with maximum storage usage. Verify no memory leaks in preset switching.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design and Implement Preset Storage Architecture [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create localStorage schema and data structures for workflow preset management with compression support
### Details:
Design the localStorage schema using 'comfyui_preset_{id}' pattern for individual presets and 'comfyui_preset_metadata' for centralized preset list management. Define TypeScript interfaces for PresetMetadata (id, name, createdAt, lastUsedAt, thumbnailData) and WorkflowPreset (metadata + compressed workflowData). Implement LZ-string compression/decompression utilities for workflow JSON storage. Create PresetStorageService class with methods for CRUD operations, storage quota monitoring, and automatic cleanup when approaching 5MB limit. Include migration strategy for future schema updates.

## 2. Build Preset Management UI Components [done]
### Dependencies: 23.1
### Description: Create collapsible preset panel with dropdown selector, save dialog, and delete confirmation matching the dark theme design system
### Details:
Implement CollapsiblePresetPanel component with smooth expand/collapse animations using the existing design system (#181825 background, blue accents). Create PresetDropdown component showing preset names, creation dates, and 'last used' badges with custom styling. Design SavePresetModal with input field for custom naming, preview of current workflow metadata, and storage usage indicator. Build DeleteConfirmationDialog with warning for currently loaded presets. Style all components with Helvetica Neue typography, consistent 8px spacing grid, and hover states matching the WebUI patterns. Position panel in the UI layout without disrupting existing workflow.

## 3. Implement Save and Load Preset Functionality [done]
### Dependencies: 23.1, 23.2
### Description: Create core functions for saving current workflows as presets and loading selected presets into the active workflow
### Details:
Implement saveWorkflowPreset() function that captures the current workflow JSON from the upload handler, compresses it using LZ-string, generates a unique timestamp-based ID, and stores it with metadata in localStorage. Create loadWorkflowPreset() that retrieves the selected preset, decompresses the workflow data, updates the workflow state through the existing modification engine, and triggers UI updates to reflect the loaded workflow. Implement updateLastUsedTimestamp() to track preset usage patterns. Add error handling for storage quota exceeded, compression failures, and invalid preset data. Integrate with existing workflow modification engine to ensure proper state updates.

## 4. Create Preset List Management and Sorting Features [done]
### Dependencies: 23.2, 23.3
### Description: Build sortable, searchable preset list with export/import capabilities for backup and sharing
### Details:
Implement PresetListManager component with sortable columns for name, created date, and last used date using click-to-sort headers. Add real-time search/filter functionality with debounced input for large preset collections. Create batch operations for selecting and deleting multiple presets. Implement exportAllPresets() function that packages all presets into a single JSON file for download. Build importPresets() with file upload, validation, and duplicate detection. Add preset thumbnails using canvas to capture a visual representation of the workflow graph. Include pagination or virtual scrolling for performance with 100+ presets.

## 5. Implement Auto-load Last Used Workflow and Storage Management [done]
### Dependencies: 23.3, 23.4
### Description: Add automatic loading of last used workflow on page load with storage monitoring and cleanup utilities
### Details:
Implement initializeLastUsedWorkflow() that runs on page load, checks for 'comfyui_last_workflow_id' in localStorage, and automatically loads the corresponding preset if it exists. Add fallback logic for missing or corrupted presets. Create StorageMonitor class that tracks localStorage usage in real-time, displays storage meter in the UI, and triggers warnings at 80% capacity. Implement intelligent cleanup suggestions based on usage patterns (unused presets, oldest presets). Add background compression optimization for older presets. Create storage analytics showing preset sizes and compression ratios. Integrate with existing app initialization flow to ensure proper loading sequence.
