   - `<Panel>`: Reusable panel component with dark theme styling (#181825 background)
   - `<Card>`: Content container with proper spacing and border styling
   - `<Divider>`: Horizontal/vertical dividers with theme-aware colors
   - `<Container>`: Responsive container with max-width constraints
   - `<Grid>` and `<Flex>`: Layout utilities with TypeScript prop types

2. **Form Components**:
   - `<Input>`: Text input with dark theme styling, error states, and TypeScript props
   - `<TextArea>`: Multi-line input with auto-resize and character counting
   - `<Select>`: Custom dropdown with portal rendering and keyboard navigation
   - `<Slider>`: Range input with value display and step controls
   - `<NumberInput>`: Numeric input with increment/decrement buttons
   - `<FileUpload>`: Drag-and-drop file upload with progress indication
   - `<FormField>`: Wrapper component with label, error, and help text

3. **Modal System**:
   - `<Modal>`: Base modal component with backdrop and focus trap
   - `<ModalProvider>`: Context provider for modal state management
   - `useModal()`: Hook for programmatic modal control
   - `<ConfirmModal>`: Pre-built confirmation dialog pattern
   - `<AlertModal>`: Alert/notification modal variant

4. **Navigation Components**:
   - `<Tabs>`: Tab navigation matching current design (txt2img, img2img, etc.)
   - `<TabPanel>`: Content panel for tab switching
   - `<Breadcrumb>`: Navigation breadcrumb component
   - `<NavLink>`: Active state-aware navigation links

5. **Button Components**:
   - `<Button>`: Base button with variants (primary, secondary, ghost, danger)
   - `<IconButton>`: Icon-only button with tooltip support
   - `<ButtonGroup>`: Group buttons with proper spacing
   - Orange gradient primary button (#ff7c00) matching current design

6. **Feedback Components**:
   - `<Toast>`: Toast notification system with queue management
   - `<Tooltip>`: Hoverable tooltips with smart positioning

7. **Data Display**:
   - `<Table>`: Sortable, filterable table component
   - `<List>`: Virtual scrolling list for performance
   - `<Badge>`: Status badges with color variants
   - `<Tag>`: Tag component for metadata display

8. **TypeScript Types**:
   ```typescript
   // Base component props
   interface BaseComponentProps {
     className?: string;
     children?: React.ReactNode;
     testId?: string;
   }

   // Form control props
   interface FormControlProps<T> extends BaseComponentProps {
     value: T;
     onChange: (value: T) => void;
     disabled?: boolean;
     error?: string;
     label?: string;
     required?: boolean;
   }

   // Theme types
   type ColorVariant = 'primary' | 'secondary' | 'success' | 'error' | 'warning';
   type SizeVariant = 'sm' | 'md' | 'lg' | 'xl';
   ```

9. **Accessibility Features**:
   - ARIA labels and roles for all interactive components
   - Keyboard navigation support (Tab, Arrow keys, Escape)
   - Focus management and visual indicators
   - Screen reader announcements for dynamic content

10. **Component Documentation**:
    - Storybook setup for component documentation
    - Usage examples and prop documentation
    - Design tokens and theme variables
    - Best practices and patterns guide

# Test Strategy:
1. **Component Testing**:
   - Unit tests for each component using React Testing Library
   - Test all prop variations and edge cases
   - Verify accessibility with jest-axe
   - Test keyboard navigation and focus management
   - Snapshot tests for style regression

2. **Integration Testing**:
   - Test component composition and nesting
   - Verify theme context propagation
   - Test modal stacking and z-index management
   - Validate form submission workflows

3. **Visual Testing**:
   - Storybook visual regression tests
   - Cross-browser rendering verification
   - Dark theme consistency checks
   - Responsive design breakpoint testing

4. **Performance Testing**:
   - Bundle size analysis for each component
   - Render performance profiling
   - Memory leak detection in dynamic components
   - Virtual scrolling performance validation

5. **Type Safety**:
   - Compile-time type checking with strict mode
   - Generic type inference validation
   - Props validation in development mode
   - Type coverage reporting
