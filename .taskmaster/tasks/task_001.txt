# Task ID: 1
# Title: Create Basic HTML Structure and Project Files
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up the fundamental project structure with comprehensive Stable Diffusion WebUI design system implementation
# Details:
Create index.html with two-panel layout: left panel (600px) for controls and right panel for output using flexbox. Include form elements for API URL input, file upload, parameter controls (steps, CFG, width, height, batch size, positive prompt), generate button, and results display area. Implement complete CSS design system with dark theme (#0b0f19 background, #181825 panels), orange gradient generate button (#ff7c00), blue accents (#1f77b4), Helvetica Neue typography, and styled components (sliders, inputs, buttons). Include responsive behavior and interactive states. Create script.js for application logic with semantic HTML structure and proper form validation.

# Test Strategy:
Verify HTML renders correctly with proper two-panel layout, all form elements are accessible and styled according to design specifications, responsive behavior works across different screen sizes, hover/focus states function properly, and file structure is organized
