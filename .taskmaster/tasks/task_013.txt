# Task ID: 13
# Title: Implement Queue Management with Cancel Button
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 11
# Priority: high
# Description: Add cancellation control for active ComfyUI generations using the /interrupt endpoint
# Details:
Create cancel button component with stop icon using design system red accent color. Integrate with ComfyUI /interrupt API endpoint. Implement button state management: hidden when idle, enabled during generation, loading state during cancellation. Add immediate UI feedback and error handling for failed cancellation attempts. Position button prominently near progress indicator. Include confirmation dialog for accidental cancellations.

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests for cancel API integration and button state logic. Integration tests with ComfyUI interrupt endpoint. User testing for cancel button placement and feedback. Error scenario testing for network failures during cancellation.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create Cancel Button Component with Design System Integration [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Build a reusable cancel button component following the established design system with proper styling and icon implementation
### Details:
Create a new CancelButton component that uses the design system's red accent color (#ef4444) for the cancel action. Implement the button with a stop icon (using existing icon library or SVG). Include proper hover, active, and disabled states. Add support for loading state with spinner to show during cancellation process. Ensure the component is fully accessible with proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation support.

## 2. Implement ComfyUI Interrupt API Integration [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create service layer for interacting with ComfyUI's /interrupt endpoint to cancel active generations
### Details:
Extend the existing ComfyUI API service to include an interrupt method that calls the /interrupt endpoint. Handle authentication if required by the ComfyUI server. Implement proper error handling for network failures, server errors, and edge cases like attempting to interrupt when no generation is active. Return appropriate response status to indicate success or failure of the interruption request.

Implementation completed successfully. Created InterruptService class following established service patterns with comprehensive error handling including custom error types (NetworkError, TimeoutError, ServerError). Added retry logic with exponential backoff for network resilience. Implemented state management with event emission for UI feedback integration. Successfully integrated with existing ComfyUIAPI.interrupt() method and added event listeners for seamless user experience. Service properly updates endpoint configuration when connection settings change, ensuring consistent operation across different ComfyUI instances.

End-to-end testing completed successfully. User confirmed that the cancel button effectively stops ComfyUI generation when clicked during active generation. The InterruptService implementation is fully functional with real ComfyUI server integration.

## 3. Implement Button State Management and Visibility Logic [done]
### Dependencies: 13.1, 13.2
### Description: Create state management logic to control cancel button visibility and enabled state based on generation status
### Details:
Integrate the cancel button with the existing WebSocket connection to track generation state. Hide the button when no generation is active. Show and enable the button during active generation. Disable the button and show loading state when cancellation is in progress. Re-hide the button when generation completes or is successfully cancelled. Use the existing generation state management system to avoid duplicating state logic.

## 4. Add Confirmation Dialog and User Feedback System [done]
### Dependencies: 13.3
### Description: Implement a confirmation dialog for accidental cancellations and immediate feedback for user actions
### Details:
Create a lightweight confirmation modal that appears when the cancel button is clicked, asking 'Are you sure you want to cancel the current generation?'. Include 'Cancel Generation' and 'Continue' buttons in the dialog. Implement immediate visual feedback when cancellation is initiated (button loading state, progress bar changes). Add success/error toast notifications to inform users of cancellation status. Ensure the dialog is keyboard accessible and can be dismissed with Escape key.

COMPLETED: Fixed error screen appearing during successful cancellation. 

ROOT CAUSE: The cancellation flag was being cleared too early - immediately after the InterruptService succeeded, but before the WebSocket execution_error event was processed. This caused the main generation error handler to see the WebSocket error as a real error rather than expected cancellation behavior.

SOLUTION: Modified the cancellation flow to keep the isCancellationInProgress flag active until the WebSocket execution_error event is received and processed. Added safety timeout to clear flag after 3 seconds if WebSocket event doesn't come.

TECHNICAL CHANGES:
1. Modified cancel button handler to keep cancellation flag active after successful interrupt
2. Added safety timeout (3 seconds) to clear flag in case WebSocket event doesn't arrive
3. WebSocket execution_error handler now properly clears the flag after handling cancellation
4. Added comprehensive debugging logs to track the cancellation flow

RESULT: Cancel button now works without showing 'Generation Failed' error screen during successful cancellation.

## 5. Position Cancel Button and Integrate with UI Layout [done]
### Dependencies: 13.4
### Description: Integrate the cancel button into the existing UI layout near the progress indicator with proper responsive design
### Details:
Position the cancel button prominently near the existing progress indicator component. Ensure the button appears in a logical location that's easily accessible during generation. Implement responsive design so the button remains properly positioned on different screen sizes. Coordinate with the progress bar animations to ensure smooth visual transitions. Update any existing layout components to accommodate the new button without breaking the current design flow.

Task 13.5 successfully completed with Option A implementation. Enhanced the .generate-section layout with proper container styling including borders, shadows, and hover effects. Improved button animations with smooth scale transforms, shimmer effects, and cubic-bezier transitions. Implemented comprehensive mobile-first responsive design with breakpoints for mobile (480px), tablet (768px), and desktop (1024px+). Mobile features full-width stacked buttons with 48px height, tablet uses centered flexible buttons with 140-200px width range, and desktop provides left-aligned buttons with 180px+ minimum width. Added smooth hover/active states with scale transforms and shimmer animation effects. The implementation maintains existing functionality while adding professional polish and improved visual integration with container styling.
