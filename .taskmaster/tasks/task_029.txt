# Task ID: 29
# Title: Phase 1.3: Service Layer Foundation - Create modular service architecture for ComfyUI API, WebSocket management, and localStorage operations with TypeScript interfaces and error handling
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 27
# Priority: medium
# Description: Build a comprehensive service layer architecture with TypeScript interfaces for all ComfyUI operations including API communication, WebSocket event handling, and local storage management, establishing a clean separation of concerns between UI components and business logic
# Details:
Implement a modular service architecture with the following components:

1. **Core Service Interfaces**: Define TypeScript interfaces for all service contracts:
   - `IComfyUIService`: Main API service for workflow submission, queue management, history retrieval
   - `IWebSocketService`: Real-time connection management with typed event handlers
   - `IStorageService`: Generic storage interface for localStorage operations
   - `IWorkflowService`: Workflow manipulation and validation operations
   - `IPresetService`: Preset CRUD operations extending storage service

2. **ComfyUI API Service Implementation**:
   ```typescript
   interface IComfyUIService {
     submitWorkflow(workflow: WorkflowData): Promise<QueueResponse>;
     getQueue(): Promise<QueueStatus>;
     getHistory(maxItems?: number): Promise<HistoryResponse>;
     interrupt(): Promise<void>;
     checkConnection(): Promise<boolean>;
   }
   ```
   - Implement with axios for HTTP operations
   - Add request/response interceptors for error handling
   - Include retry logic with exponential backoff
   - Create typed DTOs for all API responses

3. **WebSocket Service Architecture**:
   ```typescript
   interface IWebSocketService {
     connect(url: string): Promise<void>;
     disconnect(): void;
     on<T>(event: WebSocketEventType, handler: (data: T) => void): void;
     off(event: WebSocketEventType, handler: Function): void;
     getConnectionState(): ConnectionState;
   }
   ```
   - Implement event emitter pattern for typed events
   - Add automatic reconnection with configurable backoff
   - Queue messages during disconnection
   - Handle all ComfyUI WebSocket message types

4. **Storage Service Layer**:
   ```typescript
   interface IStorageService<T> {
     get(key: string): Promise<T | null>;
     set(key: string, value: T): Promise<void>;
     remove(key: string): Promise<void>;
     clear(): Promise<void>;
     getSize(): Promise<number>;
   }
   ```
   - Implement with localStorage adapter
   - Add compression for large data
   - Include storage quota management
   - Create typed storage keys enum

5. **Error Handling Strategy**:
   - Create custom error classes hierarchy:
     ```typescript
     class ComfyUIError extends Error {}
     class NetworkError extends ComfyUIError {}
     class ValidationError extends ComfyUIError {}
     class StorageQuotaError extends ComfyUIError {}
     ```
   - Implement global error boundary
   - Add error recovery mechanisms
   - Create error notification service

6. **Service Container and Dependency Injection**:
   ```typescript
   class ServiceContainer {
     private static instance: ServiceContainer;
     private services: Map<string, any> = new Map();
     
     register<T>(token: string, service: T): void;
     resolve<T>(token: string): T;
   }
   ```
   - Implement singleton pattern for service container
   - Register all services at app initialization
   - Use React context for service injection

7. **Service Configuration**:
   ```typescript
   interface ServiceConfig {
     api: {
       baseUrl: string;
       timeout: number;
       retryAttempts: number;
     };
     websocket: {
       reconnectInterval: number;
       maxReconnectAttempts: number;
     };
     storage: {
       keyPrefix: string;
       compressionThreshold: number;
     };
   }
   ```
   - Load configuration from environment variables
   - Support runtime configuration updates
   - Validate configuration on startup

# Test Strategy:
1. **Unit Testing**: Create comprehensive unit tests for each service using Jest and React Testing Library. Mock external dependencies (localStorage, WebSocket, fetch). Test error handling scenarios including network failures, timeout errors, and invalid responses. Verify retry logic and exponential backoff calculations.

2. **Integration Testing**: Test service interactions with real ComfyUI backend. Verify WebSocket reconnection after network interruption. Test storage quota exceeded scenarios. Validate service container dependency resolution.

3. **Type Safety Testing**: Use TypeScript strict mode to catch type errors. Verify all API responses match defined interfaces. Test generic type constraints in storage service. Validate event handler type safety in WebSocket service.

4. **Performance Testing**: Measure service initialization time. Test WebSocket message handling under high load. Verify storage compression effectiveness. Profile memory usage during long sessions.

5. **Error Scenario Testing**: Simulate various failure modes: API timeout, WebSocket disconnection, localStorage quota exceeded, malformed API responses. Verify error propagation and recovery mechanisms work correctly.
